                    <p> As part of the DailyUI challenge, I created a sign-up page. I decided on a music news app called Musio, where members can get live updates on their favourite artists and interact with other members. </p>

                    <p> I created a magazine cover aimed at coffee lovers. As I designed it during the winter season, I wanted it to have a warm and cosy feel. </p>

                    <p> The DailyUI challenge day two prompt was to design a checkout page. I chose a simple and familiar look that was easy to follow and use. </p>

                    <p> Running clubs have been the hype recently, so I created a run club landing page. </p>

                    <span> Illustrator | Photoshop </span>
                    <p> Experimenting with Illustrator, I decided to redesign the Mirinda drink. This was one of my most challenging projects because I wanted to design each element from scratch. I learned more about product design by doing this project and gained confidence in learning new design software. </p>

                    <span> HTML & CSS | JavaScript </span>
                    <p> During my software development boot camp, we had to do at least one JavaScript project. I decided on a countdown timer. If I were to design this again, I would make it more personalised so that users can change the background, colour scheme and timer notification message so it's not generic.

                    <p> A mini project I did during my time on Code First Girls' Web Development course. I changed my home bakery name and decided to incoporate my coding skills at the time to announce the new name change. This was posted on my Instagram bakery page which gained many positive feedback from both my clients and followers. </p>
